Alcon (abbreviation for ActionScript Logging Console) is a lightweight debugging tool for ActionScript 2.0/3.0 developers that provides a way to output debugging information (traces) from the debugged application to an external output panel.

It uses ActionScript’s LocalConnection to send the debugging information from the included Debug class to the Alcon Console. This way the developer doesn’t need to rely on the Flash/Flex IDE for debugging. Additionally Alcon offers some helpful features that make debugging easier.
